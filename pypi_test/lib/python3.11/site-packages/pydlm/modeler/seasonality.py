Code for the seasonality component

=========================================================================

This piece of code provide one building block for the dynamic linear model.
It decribes a latent seasonality trending in the time series data. The user
can use this class to construct any periodicy component to the model, for
instance, the hourly, weekly or monthly behavior. Different from the Fourier
series, the seasonality components are nonparametric, i.e., there is no sin
or cos relationship between each state. They can be arbitrarily valued.
