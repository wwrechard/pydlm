The code for long seasonality components

===========================================================================

This code implements the long seasonality component as a sub-class of dynamic.
The difference between the long seasonality is that
1) The seasonality component use each date as a unit and change in a given
periodicy. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
2) However, the long seasonality is capable to group a couple of days as the
basic unit and change in a periodicy. For example, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3,
4, 4, 4.
The usecase for long seasonality is to model longer seasonality with the
short-term seasonality. For example, the short-term seansonality can be
used to model the day of a weak patten and the long seasonality can be used
to model the week of a month patten in the same model.
Different from the dynamic component, the features in the autoReg is generated
from the data, and updated according to the data. All other features are
similar to @dynamic.
