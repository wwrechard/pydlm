Code for the dynamic component

=========================================================================

This piece of code provide one building block for the dynamic linear model.
It decribes a dynamic component in the time series data. It basically allows
user to supply covariate or controlled variable into the dlm,
and the coefficients of the features will be trained as the latent states.
Examples are holiday indicators, other observed variables and so on.

The name dynamic means that the features are changing over time.
